# enterprise-gaslogC
Created while wokring for enterprise car rental in the summer of 2016. 
All gas expenses of company cars with company credit cards were logged manually into a binder with pen and paper. 
If these logs were ever needed to be used for auditing purposes they would have to be entered into the computer manually.
I created a program with a  GUI that would save the employess name along with date,time, price paid, and vehicle description which would write locally to a csv after user input, which could then be imported into excel and used by the accounting department, as well as for audits.
